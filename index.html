        <i><h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h4></i>
        

        <p>
<i><h4>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,<br> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,remaining essentially unchanged.<br> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</h4></i>
        </p>

       <i> <h3>Why do we use it?</h3></i>
        <p>
          <i><h4>  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted<br> by the readable content of a page when looking at itslayout. The point of using<br> Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using<br> 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors<br> now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many<br> web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident,<br> sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</h4></i>

        <i><h3>Where does it come from?</h3> </i>
        <p>
         <i><h4>   Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.<br> It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it<br> over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia,<br> looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of<br> the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections<br> 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written<br> in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during<br> the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",<br> comes from a line in section 1.10.32.The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s<br> is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are <br>also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English<br> versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</h4></i>

        <i><h3>Where can I get some?</h3></i>
        <p>
           <i><h4> There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the<br> majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or<br> randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,<br> you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators<br> on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator<br> on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence<br> structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum<br> is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</h4></i>
